## CloudNine - AI Chatbot

Hey there! This is **CloudNine**, a chatbot I made using **React.js**, **Gemini API** from Google, and **Tailwind CSS**. I built it mostly for learning and fun but yeah, it's working fine.

## About the Bot

CloudNine is a simple AI chatbot where you can type messages and get smart (sometimes weird) replies using the Gemini API. It’s kinda like ChatGPT but it’s my own version. You can chat with it and it tries to talk like a human (well... mostly).

## Tech Used

- **React.js** – Frontend
- **Gemini API** – AI power from Google
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling 

## Features

- Typing box to chat
- Smooth UI with dark mode vibes
